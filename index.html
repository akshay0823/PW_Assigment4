    <h1>Features of HTML5</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Semantic Elements:</b> HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like
        header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer. These elements provide
        a more meaningful structure to web documents, making it easier for both
        developers and search engines to understand the content.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Audio and Video Support:</b> HTML5 includes native support for
        embedding audio and video content without the need for third-party
        plugins like Flash. The audio and video elements allow developers to
        embed media directly into web pages.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Canvas and SVG: </b>
        HTML5 introduced the canvas element, which provides a JavaScript API for
        drawing 2D graphics, allowing developers to create animations, games,
        and interactive graphics directly within the browser. Additionally,
        HTML5 has native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), allowing
        for high-quality vector graphics rendering.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Offline Web Applications:</b> HTML5 includes features for creating
        offline web applications. The Application Cache (AppCache) API allows
        developers to specify files that should be cached by the browser,
        enabling web apps to work offline or in low network conditions.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Web Storage: </b>
        HTML5 introduced two web storage options: localStorage and
        sessionStorage. These provide a way to store key-value pairs locally in
        a user's browser. Unlike cookies, this storage is not sent with every
        HTTP request, reducing unnecessary data transfer.
      </li>
    </ol>
